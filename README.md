# AI Singapore Competition Project
Computer Vision modelling for Singapore Sign Language. Used [PeekingDuck](https://peekingduck.readthedocs.io/en/stable/master.html) for model inference and adapted code from mainly [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmtSkq3DYko) to do action recognition

## Model

- [Model Training is done with a RNN model following the above tutorial](https://github.com/whysilon/AISG_SgSL/blob/c0e189cf949deec3c6774c9b2c6520a7e1ca8fae/Hand%20Sign%20(AR%20Model).ipynb)
- [Model Inference is done by adapting the PeekingDuck API](https://github.com/whysilon/AISG_SgSL/tree/main/PD)
